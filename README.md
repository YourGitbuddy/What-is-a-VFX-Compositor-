# 🎨 What is a VFX Compositor?

> A deep dive into the world of VFX compositing — what it is, how it works, and why it’s one of the most essential roles in film post-production.

---

## 🧩 Overview

A **VFX Compositor** is the artist responsible for combining multiple elements — CG renders, live-action footage, matte paintings, FX passes, and color grades — into a single seamless shot.

> “If the audience can’t tell what’s real and what’s not — that’s the compositor’s magic.”

This project explains **the role of a compositor** using diagrams, workflow breakdowns, and visual examples.

## 🪄 Introduction

VFX compositing is the final step in the visual effects pipeline.  
Compositors ensure that every layer — 3D render, green screen footage, background, and special effects — fits together **believably**.

---

## 🎞️ What Does a Compositor Do?

- Combine multiple image elements into one cohesive shot  
- Perform **rotoscoping**, **keying**, **tracking**, **color correction**, and **cleanup**  
- Match CG lighting to real-world footage  
- Add atmospheric effects (fog, dust, motion blur, depth of field)

| **Keying** | Removing blue/green screens cleanly. |
| **Tracking & Matchmove** | Aligning CG elements to live-action camera motion. |
| **Color Matching** | Ensuring seamless tone and lighting consistency. |
| **Cleanup/Paint** | Removing rigs, markers, and unwanted set elements. |
| **Depth & Atmospherics** | Adding fog, blur, and environmental realism. |
| **Multi-pass CG Integration** | Combining diffuse, specular, and shadow layers for realism. |
